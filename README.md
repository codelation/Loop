## Features

These are features that will make the app stand out
as being more useful than simply using a spreadsheet.

The features are listed in order of importance to the client.

### 1. Drag and drop sorting

Use JavaScript to create an interface for sorting issues
to change the priority of the issues in a project.

### 2. Autocomplete

The client would like to be able to easily jump to 
any client, project, or issue by using an autocomplete
search field for each model.

Nothing fancy is needed as far as full text search.
A simple `LIKE` query is just fine.

Each autocomplete search field should pull from
matches to the following fields:

#### Clients

- Name
- Company name
- Email address

#### Projects

- Name

#### Issues

- Title
- Body

#### BONUS

An autocomplete search that pulls in matches from all
models and groups them in the search results.

### 3. Authentication

Require the email address and password from an admin
user to manage clients, projects, etc.

Give clients user accounts so they can log in and
view their projects and issues.

#### BONUS

Use CanCan to lock down all look ups and actions to  
only the records that should be accessible to the user.
